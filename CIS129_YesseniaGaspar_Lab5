#Lab 4 The Bottle Return Program
#This lab  will excecute a program that allows input for total number of bottles, within a week, to enter.
#Then calculate a total payout amount.


#Step 1
#Declare variables
total_Bottles = 0 #store accumulated bottle values
counter = 1 #control the loop
today_Bottles = 0 #store the number of bottles returned on a day
total_Payout = 0.0 #store the calculated value of totalBottles times .10
keep_Going = "y" #used to run the program again

#loop program
while keep_Going.lower() == "y":
    #format to reset variables each week
    total_Bottles = 0
    total_Payout = 0.0

    #Variables for calculations added for days
    counter = 1
    while counter < 8:
        today_Bottles = int(input(f'Enter number of bottles returned for the day #{counter}: '))
        total_Bottles += today_Bottles #code to set the variable total_Bottles that contains the week total.       
        counter = counter + 1
        
    #code to set total_Payout using variable total_Bottles. Returns the week total payout.
    total_Payout = total_Bottles * .10


    #code to print the number of total_bottles and total_payout
    print('\nThe total number of bottles collected is ', total_Bottles)
    print('The total paid out is $', total_Payout)

    #Ask input to loop program
    keep_Going = input("""\nDo you want to enter another week's worth of data? (Enter y or n):""")

    #Insert portion of code that allows only 'y' and 'n' input
    if keep_Going.lower() !="y" and keep_Going.lower() != "n":
        print("\nPlease only enter 'y' or 'n'.")
        keep_Going = input("""Do you want to enter another week's worth of data? (Enter y or n):""")

print("You entered 'n', program ended. Thank you!")
